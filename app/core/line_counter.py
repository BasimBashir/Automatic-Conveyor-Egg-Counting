"""Trackerless line counter for one-way conveyors.

Each frame: any detection whose bbox straddles the ROI line is a candidate.
A candidate counts iff no detection was already counted near the same x
within the last `dedup_frames` frames. No IDs, no Hungarian assignment.

Suited to: one-way conveyor (top->bottom), ROI near the exit, eggs can be
back-to-back as long as they're not in the exact same lane simultaneously.
